abstract = {A new algorithmic framework is developed for holographic coherent diffraction imaging (HCDI) based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This method provides superior image reconstruction results for various practical HCDI settings, such as when data is highly corrupted by Poisson shot noise and when low-frequency data is missing due to occlusion from a beamstop apparatus. This method is also highly robust in that it can be implemented using a variety of standard numerical optimization algorithms, and requires fewer constraints on the physical HCDI setup compared to current algorithms. The mathematical framework developed using MLE is also applicable beyond HCDI to any holographic imaging setup where data is corrupted by Poisson shot noise.},

abstract = {One of the most powerful approaches to imaging at the nanometer length scale is coherent diffraction imaging using x-ray sources. For amorphous (non-crystalline) samples, raw data collected in the far-field can be interpreted as the modulus of the two-dimensional continuous Fourier transform of the unknown object. The goal is then to recover the phase through computational means by exploiting prior information about the sample (such as its support), after which the unknown object can be visualized at high resolution. While many algorithms have been proposed for this phase retrieval problem, careful analysis of its well-posedness has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we show that the problem is, in general, not well-posed and describe some of the underlying issues that are responsible for the ill-posedness. We then show how this analysis can be used to develop experimental protocols that lead to better conditioned inverse problems.}

journal = {Inverse Problems},
abstract = {A general mathematical framework and recovery algorithm is presented for the holographic phase retrieval problem. In this problem, which arises in holographic coherent diffraction imaging, a ‘reference’ portion of the signal to be recovered via phase retrieval is a priori known from experimental design. A generic formula is also derived for the expected recovery error when the measurement data is corrupted by Poisson shot noise. This facilitates an optimization perspective towards reference design and analysis. We employ this optimization perspective towards quantifying the performance of various reference choices.}

abstract = {Uniformly redundant arrays (URA) have autocorrelation functions with perfectly flat sidelobes. The URA combines the high-transmission characteristics of the random array with the flat sidelobe advantage of the nonredundant pinhole arrays. This gives the URA the capability to image low-intensity, low-contrast sources. Furthermore, whereas the inherent noise in random array imaging puts a limit on the obtainable SNR, the URA has no such limit. Computer simulations show that the URA with significant shot and background noise is vastly superior to random array techniques without noise. Implementation permits a detector which is smaller than its random array counterpart.},
